## What is Deep Freeze?
 
Deep Freeze is a software that creates a frozen snapshot of your system configuration and settings. It allows you to revert your system to that snapshot every time you restart your computer, regardless of what changes you or others have made. This way, you can keep your system clean and secure from malware, viruses, unwanted programs, and user errors.
 
Deep Freeze is useful for various scenarios, such as:

- Protecting public computers in schools, libraries, hotels, etc.
- Testing new software or updates without risking system stability.
- Preserving system performance and reducing maintenance costs.
- Preventing unauthorized changes by users or hackers.

## How does Deep Freeze work?
 
Deep Freeze works by redirecting all changes made to your system to a temporary storage space called the ThawSpace. The ThawSpace is a hidden partition or file that is created by Deep Freeze during installation. It can be located on any drive or partition on your system.
 
When you freeze your system with Deep Freeze, all changes made to your system are stored in the ThawSpace instead of being written to the actual disk. When you reboot your system, Deep Freeze discards the contents of the ThawSpace and restores your system to its original state.
 
When you thaw your system with Deep Freeze, you can make permanent changes to your system by writing them directly to the disk. You can also access the contents of the ThawSpace and save them to another location if you want to keep them. You can thaw your system temporarily or permanently depending on your needs.
